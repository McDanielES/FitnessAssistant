## Important Note:
This application will not work immediately after cloning/ forking. You MUST first create a blank text document titled `ProfilesDatabase.txt` and store it on your local repository's main directory.

This was done in an effort to protect the confidentiality of other users' sensitive data and will create a fresh database for users on each local machine.

Welcome to the Fitness Assistant GitHub, written by Eric McDaniel, in July-August 2018.
##### About <i>Eric McDaniel</i>:
I am a first year computer science student at the University of Wisconsin - Fox Valley. I am learning the fundamenals in Visual Basic.NET, Python, Java, and C++. This program was written to apply the skills learned in class into a real world context. I am aware that it may not be realistic and often crude or unsophisticated. But Live and Learn.

### To Run the Application:
+ Being a Java application, users will need to install Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK). <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">The JDK can be downloaded here.</a>
+ For those unfamiliar with GitHub, be sure to click the green "Clone or download" button, download the repository as a ZIP, and extract it on your local machine. Cloning/ Forking/ or downloading via SSH will work just as fine too for users with previous GitHub experience.
+ Make sure the `ProfilesDataBase.txt` was created and inserted in the repo's main directory.

#### Linux Users (Preferred):
+ Install openJDK in Linux to compile the `.java` files, if you haven't already done so. Example: `sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk` for Debian-based users.

#### Microsoft Windows Users:
+ Windows users are unable to compile the source code immediately without making a simple modification. <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/30018/how-to-compile-java-programs-through-windows-cmd/">Follow this guide to be able to use the javac compiler.</a>

#### macOS Users (Untested):
+ I have read that macOS comes with a Java compiler out of the box. I do not own a Macintosh and have never tested this.
+ You should be able to use the javac command in terminal to compile the source code.

### To Run the Application, Continued:
+ Compile the `FitnessAssistant.java` file which contains the <i>main</i> method. All of the necessary .class bytecode files will be automatically created.
+ Enter `java FitnessAssistant` to run the program.

#### First-time Users
You must create an account the first time you run the program. Type `n` in the first prompt to create a fresh profile, and answer the following questions.

#### Forgot your UserID and/or Password?
You can recover your login credentials by entering `y` in the main menu because you do have an account regardless of its accessibility, and typing `help` to access the recovery menu. Answer the questions to regain access. Wrong answers will not be accepted, and there is a time limit to how long you can recovery your account before being required to create a new account. When logged in, you can not only change your username and/or password, but can also change profile attributes such as your name, height, weight, etc.
