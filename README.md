# FitnessAssistant
### A user-customized BMR and fitness progress console application.

## Important Note:
This application will not work immediate after cloning/ forking.
You MUST first create a blank textfile titled 'ProfilesDatabase.txt' and
store it on your local repository's main directory.

This was done in an effort to protect the confidentiality of other users'
sensitive data and will create a fresh database for users on each local machine.
