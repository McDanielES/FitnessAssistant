# FitnessAssistant
### A user-customized BMR and fitness progress console application.
---
## Important Note:
This application will not work immediate after cloning/ forking.
You MUST first create a blank textfile titled `ProfilesDatabase.txt` and
store it on your local repository's main directory.

This was done in an effort to protect the confidentiality of other users'
sensitive data and will create a fresh database for users on each local machine.

Welcome to the Fitness Assistant GitHub, written by: <br>
<i>Eric McDaniel</i>, in July 2018.

I am a first year computer science student at the University of Wisconsin - Fox Valley. I am learning the fundamenals in Visual Basic.NET, Python, Java, and C++. This program was written to apply the skills learned in class into a real world context. I am aware that it may not be realistic and often crude or unsophisticated. But Live and Learn.

#### To Run The Application:
+ Make sure the `ProfilesDataBase.txt` was created and inserted in the repo's main directory.
+ Install a Java compiler, such as `javac` in Linux to compile .java classs, if your distro does not come with one already. Install openjdk if `javac` is not available.
+ Compile the `FitnessAssistant.java` file which contains the <i>main</i> method. All of the necessary .class bytecode files will be automatically created.
+ Enter `java FitnessAssistant` to run the program.

#### First-time User
You must create an account the first time you run the program. Type `n` in the first prompt to create a fresh profile, and answer the following questions.

#### Forgot your UserID and/or Password?
You can recover your login credentials by entering `y` in the main menu because you do have an account regardless of its accessibility, and typing `help` to access the recovery menu. Answer the questions to regain access. Wrong answers will not be accepted, and there is a time limit to how long you can recovery your account before being required to create a new account.

#### Author Contact
Should you find an error in the program and would like to contact me, you can use GitHub's `@McDanielES` tagging system to contact me. Alternatively, I am available at <i>McDanielES@gmail.com</i>. I would prefer GitHub's messaging system over my personal email.
